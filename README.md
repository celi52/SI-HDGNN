## Requirements
The code was tested with `Python 3.7`, `tensorflow-gpu 2.4`, `torch 1.8.1`, `cudnn 8.0` and `cudatoolkit 11.0`. 
Install the dependencies via Anaconda: 

```shell
# create conda virtual environment
conda create --name si-hdgnn -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.0 cudnn=8.0

# activate environment
conda activate si-hdgnn

# install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Hint: pay attention to the versions of `cudatoolkit` and `cudnn`, `tensorflow` and `torch` rely on certain versions
of them for GPU/TPU acceleration. 

## Datasets

APS and its preprocessd data can be downloaded in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JPXdSi23VS1lt0O_clxzNvaHgRl9iaIY?usp=sharing).

You can access the original APS dataset [here](https://journals.aps.org/datasets). (Released by *American Physical Society*, obtained at Jan 17, 2019)

Or DBLP-Citation-network V10, and ACM-Citation-network V9 [here](https://www.aminer.org/citation). (Released by *Aminer*)


# Run the code

For a given scientific dataset, you should:

1. Construct a heterogeneous graph
2. Get node embeddings
3. Generate scientific information cascades
4. Training & Evaluating

Detailed pre-process files information can be found [here](input_data.md).

### 1. Construct heterogeneous graph

This stage may costs a large amount of RAM (~64GB with millions of nodes/edges in graph).


```shell
# build a heterogeneous graph
> python codes/gnn_pre/graph_sample.py

# heterogeneous neighboring node sampling save and run
> python codes/gnn_pre/save_rwr.py
> python codes/gnn_pre/run_rwr.py
```

### 2. Generate node embeddings

After graph construction, we now learn node embeddings via a heterogeneous graph neural network. 

```shell script
> python codes/gnn_train/pre_train_files.py 
> python codes/gnn_train/gene_node_embeddings.py --train_iter_n 30
```

### 3. Generate scientific information cascades

Once we got the node embeddings, we can generate cascades and corresponding training/validation/test data.

#### Paper Prediction Run scripts:

```shell script
> python codes/predict_paper/1_load_emb.py
> python codes/predict_paper/2_construct_cascade.py
```

#### Author Prediction Run scripts:

```shell script
> python codes/predict_author/1_load_emb.py
> python codes/predict_author/2_x_y.py
```


### 4. Training & Evaluating SI-HDGNN

```shell script
> python codes/predict_paper/paper_prediction.py
> python codes/predict_author/author_prediction.py
```


## Options

You may change the model settings manually in `config.py` or directly into the codes.
